Requests:

Creates a game with the given ID: {

}
Response: {
    type: CREATE_GAME,
    gameId: <Int> ***** Server assigns the game an id and replies with it *****
}

Adds a player with the given color and name to the given game: {
	type: ADD_PLAYER,
    gameId: <Int>,
	color: <WHITE(true)/BLACK(false)>,
    name: <String>
}
Response: {
    type: ADD_PLAYER,
    playerId: <Int> ***** Server assigns the player an id and replies with it *****
}
Response (to other player): {
    type: ADD_PLAYER,
    name: <String> *** Opponent's name ***
}
****** Once the second player is added, the game starts immediately ******

**************************************************************
GAMEID, PLAYERID (of sender), ARE INCLUDED IN ALL OTHER 
REQUESTS (EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT EXPRESSLY LISTED)
**************************************************************

****************************************************
A player can offer a draw by pressing the ‘draw’ button.
When they do so, the other player will be notified via the DRAW_OFFERED message.
The other player can accept the draw using the same button. It will issue the SAME request (REQUEST_DRAW).
A draw offer is valid until the offer recipient makes a MOVE (not necessarily a complete turn). 
When the offer is accepted, both players will be notified via the GAME_OVER message.
****************************************************
When a player offers/accepts a draw: {
	type: REQUEST_DRAW,
}
Response to other player (if they have not requested a draw): {
	type: REQUEST_DRAW,
}
Response to both players (if both have requested a draw): {
	type: GAME_OVER,
	reason: DRAW_AGREED (3),
	result: DRAW (2)
}

***************************************
The client guarantees that there is a piece controlled 
by the moving player on the move start square.
***************************************
When a player makes a move: {
	type: PLAYER_ACTION,
    action: MOVE (1),
    move: {
        from: {
            row: <0…7>,
            col: <0…7>
        },
        to: {
            row: <0…7>,
            col: <0…7>
        }
    }
	
}
Response (if the move was illegal) {
    type: ILLEGAL_ACTION,
}
Response (if the move was legal): {
	type: GAME_UPDATE,
    updates (if power boxes spawned or the state of certain pieces changed, 
            e.g. loss of invulnerability or expiration of black hole): [
        ****************************************************
        Updates are represented by piece transformations, e.g. 
        BLACK_HOLE -> NOTHING. Only the NEW state need be provided. 
        Also, updates are evaluated AFTER MOVES, so if the moving 
        piece needs to be updated, update the move-to square.

        followUp2: <NONE(0)/MOVE(1)/SELECT_SQUARE(3)/SELECT_PIECE(4)/MOVE_THIS(5)>
        ************************************************************
        followUp: some powers require the player to make additional
        choices, e.g. move again or select an enemy piece to destroy.
        NONE = no further action. SELECT_SQUARE = select empty square.
        MOVE_THIS = the moving piece must be moved again.
