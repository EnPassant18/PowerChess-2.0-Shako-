# cs0320 Term Project 2018

**Team Members:** Brad Bentz, Daniel Kostovetsky, Dain Woods, Katie Normand

**Team Strengths and Weaknesses:**
Daniel: My strengths are functional programming, data structures and algorithms. I studies these extensively in CS19. My weaknesses are object-oriented design and UI design, since I have relatively little experience in these areas. I never took an object-oriented programming course before.

**Project Idea(s):** 
(1) PowerChess: Chess with Powerups that temporarily change the rules of the game (for instance, allowing multiple moves by one player, allowing pawns to move backwards, resurrecting dead pieces, etc.). Accomodating such rule changes would make for an interesting design challenge. We could also add an AI and a feature for playing opponents over the Internet.
